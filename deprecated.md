# Deprecated Designs

These designs have all been superceded by more functional shapes.

[wichard\_snaphook\_handle](wichard_snaphook_handle.scad) - a cone-and-ball handle to open the gate of a Wichard Snap shackle. The wall thickness is thin at the base of the cone and the transition is harsh.

[stopper\_block\_v3](stopper_block_v3.scad) - This block is used in tandem with the stopper ball to form a moveable stopper. This 3D model has never been tested in the field. It is 4mm narrow than stopper\_block\_v2 and uses octagonal horizontal bores to reduce overhang issues when printing. An [STL file](printable/stopper_block_v3_9c3c682.stl) is available.

[stopper\_block\_v2](stopper_block_v2.scad) - This block is used in tandem with the stopper ball to form a moveable stopper. This 3D model has never been tested. That said, it is based on a hand-made design, cut from Delrin, that has been tested extensively. This model is closer to the hand-made design than the original [stopper\_block](stopper_block.scad) model.

[stopper\_block](stopper_block.scad) - This block is used in tandem with the stopper ball to form a moveable stopper.  This 3D model has never been tested. That said, it is based on a hand-made design, cut from Delrin, that has been tested extensively.  The edges of this model are far harsher than what is possible when machining such a block from Delrin. The harsh edges might make it unsuitable for regular use.

[wichard\_snaphook\_release\_cone](wichard_snaphook_release_cone.scad) - a cone to open the gate of a Wichard Snap shackle.  This component has never been tested.
