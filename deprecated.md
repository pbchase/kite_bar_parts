**Three part wichard snaphook** -  This design is uses six components to form a fid and a handle to actuate a wichard snaphook. The components are
[wichard\_snaphook\_handle\_concave\_link](wichard_snaphook_handle_concave_link.scad),
[wichard\_snaphook\_cone\_fid](wichard_snaphook_cone_fid.scad) and
[wichard\_snaphook\_handle\_for\_cone\_fid](wichard_snaphook_handle_for_cone_fid.scad).  [STL files](printable/) are available for each.  A pair of each component is printed to out fit a single snaphook. This design accidentally released once in a 3 hour session. That's still too high.

[wichard\_snaphook\_handle\_golf\_tee\_style](wichard_snaphook_handle_golf_tee_style.scad) - a cone-and-flange handle to open the gate of a Wichard Snap shackle. An [STL file](printable/wichard_snaphook_handle_golf_tee_style_8677c59.stl) is available. While this model reliably opens the gate and does so with little force it has opened unexpectedly in field testing. This happened three times in about 5 hours of testing. The problem occurs when the harness and the handles are forced down onto the pilot's thigh. Apprently, the base of the handle stands on the thigh as the snap hook is forced down against the thigh. This pulls the cord in the gate, pulls the opposite handle into the gate and triggers the release. See  _Untested Models_ below for the next iteration of the design.

[wichard\_snaphook\_handle](wichard_snaphook_handle.scad) - a cone-and-ball handle to open the gate of a Wichard Snap shackle. The wall thickness is thin at the base of the cone and the transition is harsh.

[stopper\_block\_v3](stopper_block_v3.scad) - This block is used in tandem with the stopper ball to form a moveable stopper. This 3D model has never been tested in the field. It is 4mm narrow than stopper\_block\_v2 and uses octagonal horizontal bores to reduce overhang issues when printing. An [STL file](printable/stopper_block_v3_9c3c682.stl) is available.

[stopper\_block\_v2](stopper_block_v2.scad) - This block is used in tandem with the stopper ball to form a moveable stopper. This 3D model has never been tested. That said, it is based on a hand-made design, cut from Delrin, that has been tested extensively. This model is closer to the hand-made design than the original [stopper\_block](stopper_block.scad) model.

[stopper\_block](stopper_block.scad) - This block is used in tandem with the stopper ball to form a moveable stopper.  This 3D model has never been tested. That said, it is based on a hand-made design, cut from Delrin, that has been tested extensively.  The edges of this model are far harsher than what is possible when machining such a block from Delrin. The harsh edges might make it unsuitable for regular use.

[wichard\_snaphook\_release\_cone](wichard_snaphook_release_cone.scad) - a cone to open the gate of a Wichard Snap shackle.  This component has never been tested.
